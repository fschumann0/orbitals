# Hydrogen Quantum Orbital Simulation

This repository includes the raw code for the quantum orbital simulation. 3D and 2D versions are available.

The simulation visualizes the probability distribution of an electron in different quantum states. It uses **Pygame** for real-time rendering and **NumPy/SciPy** for mathematical computations of the wavefunctions.

Web version: Coming soon...
